## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Node.js**: version 22.12.0 or higher, or 24.0.0 or higher;
- **TypeScript**: version 5.8.0 to 5.8.x;
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.

### Project Dependencies
This desktop application requires the following components to be deployed and configured before use:

1. **[Museum Alert API](https://github.com/humana-fragilitas/museum-alert-api)** - AWS CDK infrastructure project that provides:
   - AWS API Gateway endpoints;
   - Amazon Cognito authentication services;
   - AWS IoT Core configuration;
   - required environment configuration files.

   **After deploying the museum-alert-api project:**
   - **Find the configuration**: Look for the `AngularAppConfiguration` output in your CDK deployment console
   - **Copy the complete configuration**: The deployment output provides a ready-to-copy `APP_CONFIG` object
   - **Update environment files**: Paste the configuration into the appropriate environment files in `src/environments/environment.*.ts`
   - **Configuration format**: The output includes all required AWS endpoints, Cognito pool IDs, IoT Core settings, and region configuration

2. **[Museum Alert Sensor (MAS)](https://github.com/humana-fragilitas/museum-alert-sketch)** - Hardware device with firmware that must be built and flashed to the Arduino Nano ESP32 before using this desktop application. The sensor most notably provides:
   - configurable ultrasonic distance barrier (2cm to 4 meters) with WiFi connectivity and alert notifications via MQTT;
   - configurable BLE Eddystone-URL beacon suitable for proximity notifications.

**Important**: the desktop application is specifically designed to configure, provision on AWS IoT Core, and test the Museum Alert Sensor. Therefore, the sensor firmware must be built and deployed to the hardware device before this desktop application can be used effectively. Deploy these dependencies in the specified order before setting up this desktop application.

⚠️ **Please read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) before using this project.**

## Getting Started

### Installation

This project follows the [Electron Builder two package.json structure](https://www.electron.build/tutorials/two-package-structure), requiring separate dependency installations for the renderer and main processes.

**Step 1: Install renderer process dependencies (Angular/Web)**
```bash
npm install
```

**Step 2: Install main process dependencies (Electron/Node.js)**
```bash
cd app/
npm install
cd ..
```

### Project Structure

| Directory | Process Type | Technology Stack | Description |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| `src/`    | Renderer     | Angular/Web      | User interface and web-based functionality |
| `app/`    | Main         | Node.js/Electron | System integration and native platform features |

### Configuration Setup

Before running the application, you must configure the environment files with values generated by the Museum Alert API project. See the [Environment File Dependencies](#environment-file-dependencies) section for detailed instructions.

## Environment Configuration

This project uses different environment files depending on which npm script is executed:

| NPM Script | Angular Config | Environment File Used |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| `npm start` | `-c web` (via `ng:serve`) | `environment.web.ts` |
| `npm run build` | default (no `-c` flag) | `environment.ts` |
| `npm run build:dev` | `-c dev` | `environment.dev.ts` |
| `npm run build:prod` | `-c production` | `environment.prod.ts` |
| `npm run web:build` | `-c web-production` | `environment.web.prod.ts` |
| `npm run electron:local` | `-c dev` (via `build:dev`) | `environment.dev.ts` |
| `npm run electron:build` | `-c production` (via `build:prod`) | `environment.prod.ts` |
| `npm run e2e` | `-c production` (via `build:prod`) | `environment.prod.ts` |

### Environment File Dependencies

**Important Note**: The environment files in this project (`src/environments/environment.*.ts`) are shipped empty by design. 

This desktop application depends on the infrastructure and configuration generated by the [**museum-alert-api**](https://github.com/humana-fragilitas/museum-alert-api) AWS CDK project, which:

1. **creates the AWS infrastructure** (API Gateway, Cognito, IoT Core, etc.);
2. **generates the actual environment configuration** with real endpoint URLs, resource IDs, and credentials;
3. **outputs configuration files** that need to be copied into this project's environment files.

**Setup Process**:
1. first deploy the [museum-alert-api](https://github.com/humana-fragilitas/museum-alert-api) CDK project;
2. copy the generated configuration from the CDK output into the appropriate environment files in this project;
3. then run this desktop application.

**Why environment files are empty**:
- real AWS resource endpoints and IDs are only known after CDK deployment;
- configuration values (like Cognito Pool IDs, API Gateway URLs, IoT endpoints) are dynamically generated;
- this ensures each deployment gets unique, secure resource identifiers;
- prevents accidental exposure of sensitive configuration in the repository.

Refer to the [museum-alert-api documentation](https://github.com/humana-fragilitas/museum-alert-api) for detailed setup instructions.

## Available Commands

This project provides comprehensive npm scripts for development, building, testing, and deployment. Commands are organized by functionality.

**Important Note**: this application is designed specifically as an Electron desktop application. While some commands include Web/browser functionality, they are primarily used internally for development features (like hot reload) and are not recommended for production use as a web application.

### Development Commands

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Starts the full development environment with hot reload | **Recommended**: Primary development command - runs both Angular dev server and Electron in parallel |
| `npm run ng:serve` | Starts only the Angular development server in web mode | **Internal use**: Provides hot reload capability for `npm start` - not recommended for standalone development |
| `npm run electron:serve` | Starts Electron pointing to the development server | **Internal use**: Used internally by `npm start` - waits for Angular dev server to be ready |

### Build Commands

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Basic build with default environment | Standard build for local testing |
| `npm run build:dev` | Build with development environment configuration | **Recommended**: Development builds with dev-specific settings |
| `npm run build:prod` | Build with production environment configuration | **Recommended**: Production builds for distribution |
| `npm run web:build` | Build for web deployment (no Electron) | **Not recommended**: Creates web version but application requires Electron features |

### Electron Commands

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm run electron:local` | Builds with dev config and runs Electron locally | **Recommended**: Testing the full Electron app without packaging |
| `npm run electron:build` | Builds with production config and packages the app | **Recommended**: Creating distributable Electron applications for your OS |
| `npm run electron` | Runs Electron directly without building | **Not recommended**: Requires manual build steps first - use `electron:local` or `electron:build` instead |

### Testing Commands

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm test` | Runs unit tests once | Quick test validation |
| `npm run test:ci` | Runs unit tests with coverage report | CI/CD pipelines and coverage analysis |
| `npm run test:watch` | Runs unit tests in watch mode | Active development with continuous testing |
| `npm run e2e` | Runs end-to-end tests | Basic example of application testing before releases |
| `npm run e2e:show-trace` | Opens Playwright trace viewer | Debugging failed E2E tests |

### Utility Commands

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm run ng` | Angular CLI passthrough | Running Angular CLI commands directly |
| `npm run version` | Generates changelog and prepares version | Release preparation |
| `npm run electron:serve-tsc` | Compiles TypeScript for Electron main process | Used internally by other commands |

### Common Workflows

- **Daily Development**: `npm start` (starts everything you need for Electron development);
- **Local Electron Testing**: `npm run electron:local` (test full desktop application);
- **Production Build**: `npm run electron:build` (create distributable desktop app);
- **Before Commit**: `npm test`;
- **Full Testing**: `npm run test:ci && npm run e2e`.

**Note**: web-only commands like `npm run ng:serve` are not recommended for this project as the application is designed to leverage Electron's native capabilities (serial port communication, file system access, etc.) that are not available in standard web browsers.
