## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Node.js**: version 22.19.0 or higher;
- **Python**: version 3.11;
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or GNU/Linux.

### Project Dependencies
"Museum Alert Desktop" requires the following components to be deployed and configured before use:

1. **[Museum Alert API](https://github.com/humana-fragilitas/museum-alert-api)** - AWS CDK infrastructure project that provides:
   - AWS API Gateway endpoints;
   - Amazon Cognito authentication and authorization services;
   - AWS IoT Core configuration;
   - required environment configuration files.

   **After deploying the Museum Alert API Infrastructure:**
   - **find the configuration**: look for the [`AngularAppConfiguration`](https://github.com/humana-fragilitas/museum-alert-api?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-output) output in your CDK deployment console;
   - **copy the complete configuration**: the deployment output provides a ready-to-copy `APP_CONFIG` object;
   - **update environment files**: paste the configuration into the appropriate [environment files](#environment-configuration) in `src/environments/environment.*.ts`.

2. **[Museum Alert Sensor (MAS)](https://github.com/humana-fragilitas/museum-alert-sketch)** - Hardware device with firmware that must be built and flashed to the ArduinoÂ® Nano ESP32 before using this desktop application. The sensor most notably provides:
   - configurable ultrasonic distance barrier (2cm to 4 meters) with WiFi connectivity and alert notifications via MQTT;
   - configurable BLE Eddystone-URL beacon suitable for proximity notifications.

## Getting Started

### Environment Configuration

Different environment files are available depending on which npm script is executed:

| NPM Script | Angular Config | Environment File Used |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| `npm start` | `-c web` (via `ng:serve`) | `environment.web.ts` |
| `npm run build` | default (no `-c` flag) | `environment.ts` |
| `npm run build:dev` | `-c dev` | `environment.dev.ts` |
| `npm run build:prod` | `-c production` | `environment.prod.ts` |
| `npm run web:build` | `-c web-production` | `environment.web.prod.ts` |
| `npm run electron:local` | `-c dev` (via `build:dev`) | `environment.dev.ts` |
| `npm run electron:build` | `-c production` (via `build:prod`) | `environment.prod.ts` |
| `npm run e2e` | `-c production` (via `build:prod`) | `environment.prod.ts` |

### Installation

This project follows the [Electron Builder's two package.json structure](https://www.electron.build/tutorials/two-package-structure), requiring separate dependency installations for the renderer and main processes.

**Step 1: Install renderer process dependencies (Angular/Web)**
```bash
npm install
```

**Step 2: Install main process dependencies (Electron/Node.js)**
```bash
cd app/
npm install
cd ..
```

### Project Structure

| Directory | Process Type | Technology Stack | Description |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| `src/`    | Renderer     | Angular/Web      | User interface and Web-based functionality |
| `app/`    | Main         | Node.js/Electron | System integration and native platform features |

## Available Commands

**Note**: Museum Alert Desktop is specifically designed as an Electron desktop application; while some commands include Web/browser functionality, they are primarily used internally for development features (like hot reload).

### Development Commands

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Starts the full development environment with hot reload | **Recommended**: primary development command - runs both Angular dev server and Electron in parallel |
| `npm run ng:serve` | Starts only the Angular development server in Web mode | **Internal use**: provides hot reload capability for `npm start` - not recommended for standalone development |
| `npm run electron:serve` | Starts Electron pointing to the development server | **Internal use**: used internally by `npm start` - waits for Angular dev server to be ready |

### Build Commands

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Basic build with default environment | Standard build for local testing |
| `npm run build:dev` | Build with development environment configuration | **Recommended**: development builds with dev-specific settings |
| `npm run build:prod` | Build with production environment configuration | **Recommended**: production builds for distribution |
| `npm run web:build` | Build for Web deployment (no Electron) | **Not recommended**: creates Web version but application requires Electron features |

### Electron Commands

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm run electron:local` | Builds with dev config and runs Electron locally | **Recommended**: testing the full Electron app without packaging |
| `npm run electron:build` | Builds with production config and packages the app | **Recommended**: creating distributable Electron applications for your OS |
| `npm run electron` | Runs Electron directly without building | **Not recommended**: requires manual build steps first - use `electron:local` or `electron:build` instead |

### Testing Commands

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm test` | Runs unit tests once | Quick test validation |
| `npm run test:ci` | Runs unit tests with coverage report | CI/CD pipelines and coverage analysis |
| `npm run test:watch` | Runs unit tests in watch mode | Active development with continuous testing |
| `npm run e2e` | Runs end-to-end tests | Basic example of application testing before releases |
| `npm run e2e:show-trace` | Opens Playwright trace viewer | Debugging failed E2E tests |

### Utility Commands

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm run ng` | Angular CLI passthrough | Running Angular CLI commands directly |
| `npm run electron:serve-tsc` | Compiles TypeScript for Electron main process | Used internally by other commands |

### Common Workflows

- **Daily Development**: `npm start` (starts everything you need for Electron development);
- **Local Electron Testing**: `npm run electron:local` (test full desktop application);
- **Production Build**: `npm run electron:build` (create distributable desktop app);
- **Before Commit**: `npm test`;
- **Full Testing**: `npm run test:ci && npm run e2e`.
